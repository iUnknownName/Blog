        <h3>Origins of the world and the gods</h3>
        <p>
          "Myths of origin" or "creation myths" represent an attempt to explain
          the beginnings of the universe in human language. The most widely
          accepted version at the time, although a philosophical account of the
          beginning of things, is reported by Hesiod, in his Theogony. He begins
          with Chaos, a yawning nothingness. Out of the void emerged Gaia (the
          Earth) and some other primary divine beings: Eros (Love), the Abyss (the
          Tartarus), and the Erebus. Without male assistance, Gaia gave birth to
          Uranus (the Sky) who then fertilized her.

        <h3>Age of gods and mortals</h3>
        <p>Bridging the age when gods lived alone and the age when divine interference in human affairs was limited was a transitional age in which gods and mortals moved together. These were the early days of the world when the groups mingled more freely than they did later. 
        Most of these tales were later told by Ovid's Metamorphoses and they are often divided into two thematic groups: tales of love, and tales of punishment.</p>
